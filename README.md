# Texas_GIS_Scanner
This program sorts through the Texas GIS Interface and grabs data by downloading the csv extension that they provide. I wrote this without knowing that this data was already on Enverus. Although we don't need this data, there might other uses for the program if tweaked with changes. I used this when matching up APIs to Lease IDs for Jennifer by searching the Lease ID on Texas GIS.
